Last night I had 5 hours of sleep, so I was very tired this morning. I probably shouldn't have gone skating. But I got on the bike (non e-bike) to warm up. Once I got to the rink I did some [dynamic stretching](http://www.barclayphysicaltherapy.com/Sports-Activities/Figure-Skating/Stretching-Guide-for-Figure-Skating/a~1690/article.html) and got into the rink.

I spent some time on power stroking -- I can do the backwards pretty well and I did the full pattern several times. So that was great!

3 Turns -- Next I worked on inside 3s. But I they weren't going that well so I moved to forward 3 turns. The forwards were okay, although I think my checking isn't all that great. I kind of feel like I'm a bat the way I'm keeping my arms stiff.

Progressives -- I practised these a little bit. I realized that I take my foot off the circle at about 5 on the clock face. Still not feeling confident enough to put my foot down between 1 and 2 going at speed but that's okay for now.

Actually it was great to be able to skate well again. I loved having full mobility back.

Afterwards, I did some static stretching from the same website. It felt pretty good!
