Today was the first time I've been skating since March 2020. Of course, I only started skating again early this year in February after not skating for about 2 years, so the pandemic forcibly breaking it didn't help!

Anyways, my coach of about 3 or 4 sessions from earlier this year is sadly no longer teaching. So I met with my second coach this year! She's great. We talked about why I want to skate and what I want to work on.

What I want to work on is:
- Passing the Moves in the Field Pre-Juvenile Test. I have Preliminary and Pre-Preliminary. I was working on MIF Pre-Juveline and I've never really gotten the hang of the backward figure 8 so that was my blocker from passing that test when I last skated two years ago.
- Starting to do Freeystyle tests -  this means learning how to do spins and jumps. My nemesis!

We stroked around the ice a bit and did some cross overs on the circle so she could see where I was at.

Then worked on the entrance to a two foot spin with feet pointing in in order to progress to a one foot spin easily. I spent the rest of the session after the lesson working on the spin entrance.
