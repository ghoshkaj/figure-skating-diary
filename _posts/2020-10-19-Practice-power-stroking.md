Today I had a full agenda. I had one hour of ice time a 4 items to practice:1) power stroking 2) progressives 3) two foot spin with entry 4) get familiar with remaining MIF figures for pre-juvenile. That meant 15 minutes for each item.

Power stroking: I have forwards down but the backwards strokes leave a lot to be desired. I don't have full control over them yet and they're not very powerful. So they only fill have the length of the rink instead of the full rink. The other problem is I don't have a sense for where the tops and bottoms of the lobes need to be so it's making it harder to aim for those spots. Lastly, I'm pretty sure I'm holding my hands wrong so it's throwing me off-course a little bit.

Progressives: I need more instruction on these. Or I need to do some more reasearch into these myself. I can sort of barely do but it requires intense concentration and they don't look graceful because I have to focus so much. 

Two foot spint with entry: I think I'm starting to get the hang of this -- I can now make it into the spin -- but my feet are pointing out awkwardly at weird angles here so I need to focus on my feet and keeping my core taut and pulled in. I also took a big old fall that made my right thigh hurt a lot so I didn't continue working on thes for too long.

Prejuvenile MIF - inside and outside 3s: I could have sworn that these figures were from an earlier exam. I guess they're not! Well I tried doing them and they're okay but I definitely don't have enough strength in my core to keep my torso turned enough to make the backward threes look natural and graceful. It all comes back to that pesky core that seems to be made of jelly for me currently. So here, I need to keep practising of course, and I need to check with coach about her suggestions - but also I need to work on core strength off-ice.

It's three days since practice and my right side where I fell is still sore. Not too much though -- but enough! Well, I have a lesson tomorrow so my body better stop protesting!
