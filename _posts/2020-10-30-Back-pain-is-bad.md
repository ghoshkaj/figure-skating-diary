My muscles keep getting really stiff after skating. I got a lot of sleep the night before last so I don't think it was that. And I stretched, but I guess it's a bit too little a bit too late. I didn't make it to skating or my lesson today because my muscles have just seized up and are too stiff. My lower back keeps twinging painfully as if my muscle is about to go out again. I guess I need to give my muscles full time to recover.

For the next week instead of classes, I've decided to learn all the moves in pre-juvenile and the jumps and spins for freestyle 1.
