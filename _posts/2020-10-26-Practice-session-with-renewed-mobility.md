title: Practice and renewed mobility

I had an hour of practice today. Luckily my back muscle had recovered a lot so I had pretty much full mobility back. I spent about half the time practising the perimeter power stroking. I can do the backward strokes again, although sometimes I lose track of where I should be doing the cross over after two lobes. So I suppose I need to focus on practising the pattern in my mind before getting on the ice so I can use the ice time a bit better.

Inside 3s - I only barely practised these. There were a lot of people occupying that side of the rink while I was trying to practice them so I kept having to get out of the way. So these still look ungracious and forced when it comes to the 3 turn.

Progressives - I practised these on a circle but honestly didn't feel confident enough to put my goot down at the half point between the 1 and 2 on a clock fave. I'm taking my foot off on the 3 so I don't have any time at all before I have to put it back down. Maybe I need to pick it up earlier for progressives? I'll ask Coach about it.

Two foot spin - I'm having trouble tightening the half circle into a 3 turn so I often find myself not on the inner edge of the right foot. Would like to spend more time on this pattern with Coach.

I have practice again on Thursday, so I'll just have to see how far I get with practice on Thursday!
